# simpletest

* Test driven development

- In this project I improve my JS skills by recreating native array methods. To make it most accurate and transparent, I stick to test-driven development approach, means, I read the Doc, then create prototype and then write test cases for each feature, described in Documentation and make sure, that my function passes all the tests, modifying the prototype as needed.
For testing I use the tool for automated testing (based on Tinytest) and modified by me for cleaner UI.
